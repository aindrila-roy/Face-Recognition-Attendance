# Face Recognition Attendance System
This is my Final Year Project. It uses Python and OpenCV to automate attendance via face recognition.

## Features
* **Real-time Detection:** Uses Haar Cascades for face detection.
* **Data Logging:** Saves attendance records in CSV format with timestamps.
* **User-friendly:** Simple interface to add new students/users.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run add_faces.py to register a new face.
3. Run test.py (or your main app) to start the attendance system.
